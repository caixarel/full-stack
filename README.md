#Full Stack App with React and a REST API

In this project i am building a frontend app using React that will link to the backend app located on the folder "api".
This app will allow users to view a list of courses and the detail for a specific course, sign up to create an account or sign in with an existing account, and create, update, or delete courses on a school database.

*To use this app is necessary to download the full project containing the "api" and "client" folders.
*Then start by accessing the "api" folder and use the terminal to install the necessary dependencies using the command npm install.Then use the commands npm run seed to reinitiate the database and npm start to start the backend application.
-Next on the "client" folder re-run npm install and npm start.
-by now the full app should be ready to use. 
-Finally on your web browser go to page http://localhost:3000/ and enjoy the content of this project>
